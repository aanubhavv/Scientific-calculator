# Decentralized Voting Application

This is a demo application to implement voting in solidity smart contract using ReactJS. 

## Installation

After you cloned the repository, you want to install the packages using

```shell
npm install
```

* You first need to compile the contract and upload it to the blockchain network using Remix IDE.

* Once the contract is uploaded to the blockchain, copy the contract address and contract ABI then paste it in the constant.js file.

* Once you have pasted your ABI and contract address in the constant.js file, simply run command

```shell
npm start
```

** ensure that your Metamask wallet remains connected to the same blockchain network on which the contract was deployed.
